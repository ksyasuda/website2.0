<h2>Introduction</h2>

I solved my first Rubik's Cube in a room at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada where my family and I were staying during my little sisters' basketball tournament.

As a result, the very first Rubik's Cube I owned and solved was a M&M themed cube from the M&M factory in Vegas, which had the stickers on in the wrong orientation.

After years of practicing and practicing I have brought my fastest solve time down to under 10 seconds.

It wasn't until my sophomore year of college at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor in which I decided to, in a class unrelated to Computer Science, create a program to solve and output the solve for any givem permutation of a Rubik's Cube.

<p id="small-text">The full story behind why I was writing a program for a research project in a course unrelated to computer science will be explained in full detail in a future blog post</p>
