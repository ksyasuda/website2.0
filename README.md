# Sudacode Website/Blog

This is my personal website and blog, where I can write about projects that I am
currently working on as well as topics that interest me.

## How It's Made

This website was built using [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/ "Gatsby
Homepage"), a "React-based, open-source, framework for creating websites and
apps."  The website is hosted on [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/
"Firebase homepage") and utlizes the ***Firebase Realtime Database*** on the backend.

The [travel](https://sudacode.com/travel) section of my website calls a REST API
I created with ***node.js*** and ***express*** to pull location and weather data
on request.  The node application is hosted on [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home "Heroku homepage").
