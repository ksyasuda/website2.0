My coding background, prior to learning web development, had mostly been in strongly typed languages such as C++ land Java. I had known that TypeScript existed and that it was a superset of JavaScript. The problem was when I discovered TypeScript, I was in the process of learning HTML, css, and JavaScript and wanted to focus on learning those before I jumped into learning TypeScript. Now I feel that my knowledge of JavaScript is at the point where I can jump into learning TypeScript. While I am not a JavaScript master yet, having only used the language for a little over 4 months now, since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, I can continue to learn JavaScript and use JavaScript after learning TypeScript.

## Where to start

The first place I always start when learning how to use a new programming language, framework, or library is the [official documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html "TypeScript documentation V2 | The Basics").

Since I had spent the time to learn JavaScript prior to learning TypeScript, I
was able to follow the TypeScript for JavaScript devs tutorial.

<p style="text-align: center;">The documentations typically includes many examples along with the explanation of each concept and rule.</p>

For each example in the docs, I created a small function, class, or code snippet that utilizes the concept shown in the example.

## Helpful Extension

One helpful extension that I used when learning both JavaScript and TypeScript
was the [Quokka.js extension for vscode](https://quokkajs.com/ "QUOKKA Home
Page"), which is a tool for "Rapid JavaScript/TypeScript prototyping. Runtime
values are updated and displayed in your IDE next to your code as you type."

With this extension I was able to quickly see whether or not my code snippets
were working.

## Starting my First TypeScript Project

After I have finished going through the official documentation, I like to create
little programs that utilize what I have learned.

For this, I decided to create a Balance Book App that will allow the user to log
every transaction made and calculate the montly spending summary as well as the
overall balance.

I thought that this would be a good choice for a small projects as all I really
need to create is the layout, the input form for each transaction, a transaction
React component for its reusability, and a base class to keep track of
everyting.

In the future, I plan to connect this client side application with my own backend RESTful API using SQLite, Node.js, and Express.js
