My coding background, prior to learning web development, had mostly been in strongly typed languages such as C++ land Java.  I had known that TypeScript existed and that it was a superset of JavaScript.  The problem was when I discovered TypeScript, I was in the process of learning HTML, css, and JavaScript and wanted to focus on learning those before I jumped into learning TypeScript.  Now I feel that my knowledge of JavaScript is at the point where I can jump into learning TypeScript.  While I am not a JavaScript master yet, having only used the language for a little over 4 months now, since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, I can continue to learn JavaScript and use JavaScript after learning TypeScript.

## Where to start

The first place I always start when learning how to use a new programming language, framework, or library is the [official documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/basic-types.html "TypeScript documentation V2 | The Basics").

<p style="text-align: center;">The documentations typically includes many examples along with the explanation of each concept and rule.</p>
