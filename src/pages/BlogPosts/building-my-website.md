## Introduction

This past summer I decided to take a break from C/C++, the languages that I had been using almost exclusively for the past three years at the University of Michigan, and get into web development. C/C++ are great languages, but it can be hard to share and show off projects to others who do not know how to use a Makefile, for instance. Projects built on the web are much more accessible and the results are, I would argue, more tangible to the average user. That is why I decided to get into web development, and specifically React.js.
