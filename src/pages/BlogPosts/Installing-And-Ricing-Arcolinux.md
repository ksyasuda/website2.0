## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Over the past 4 months, I have been messing around with and learning how to use
Arch Linux, which I installed and talked about in [another blog post](). Since
then, I have become very farmiliar with Linux, the command-line, and using an
Arch-based system. Additionally, I have found a plethora of packages and spent
countless hours configuring my sytem to my liking. One such package was the
[i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) Window Manager. After using a tiling
Window Manager like i3, it is hard to go back to using floating window managers.
Becuaues of this, I made the decision to wipe Windows from my main laptop, a
Dell Xps 13 9380, and install Arch Linux.

This time around, I didn't want to go through the entire install process again,
and knew that there existed arch-based distributions that had installers
built-in. I settled on [Arcolinux](https://arcolinux.com/), which can come
pre-configured with a variety of different desktop environments and window
managers. For my install, I chose the ArcolinuxD with KDE Plasma installed.

After downloading the ISO, I used the tool
[Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to flash the ISO onto a USB drive,
plugged the USB into my computer, and booted into Arcolinux. Arcolinux comes
with the https://calamares.io/ installer, which is a point and click interface
for setting up the system and installing some initial packages.

## Installing i3 Window Manager <a name="install-i3"></a>

The ISO that I chose came with KDE Plasma installed by default, which I chose
because I want to be able to use some of the Plasma apps, customization, and
widgets. However, KDE Plasma comes with its own window manager that is not a
floating window manager like i3. However, i3 is compatible with KDE Plasma.
First, I installed the fork of i3, [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3),
which allows for spacing between and around windows. Next, to use a new window
manager with Plasma, there are two options: a system-wide change, or a user
change. I chose to do a system-wide change by adding a XSession.

## Setting up Oh-My-Zsh <a name="oh-my-zsh"></a>

After setting up i3 with KDE, I immediately set up git with

```bash
git config --global user.name "username"
git config --global user.email "email"
```

Then I followed the guide on GitHub to generate and add a new ssh key to my account so that I could have git set up and so that I could clone my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/ksyasuda/dotfiles).

My `.bashrc` and `.zshrc` both depend on certain packages being installed before I can use them without errors. For instance, my `.zshrc` has a section at the bottom that sources folders generated by packages like `go` or `python`. Example lines from the file can be seen below.

```sh
~/.zshrc
# add emacs to path
export PATH=$PATH:/home/sudacode/.emacs.d/bin
#Enable tab completions for flags in colorls
source $(dirname $(gem which colorls))/tab_complete.sh
# add python to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/bin/python"
# add jdk-8 to path
export PATH="$PATH:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk/bin"
```

Additionally, the version of Arcolinux that I installed came with [Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) installed already, however, it was not installed in the way that is recommended by the developers. As a result, I reinstalled Oh-My-Zsh using the command
`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"`. Next, I had to install fonts and plugins to be able to work with my `.zshrc`.

The version of the theme that I use for Oh-My-Zsh, [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k), requires a Nerd Font for the glyphs. For this, I installed [nerd-fonts-fira-code](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/nerd-fonts-fira-code/) from the AUR, which is the collection of Fira Code Nerd Fonts.

Next, I had to install some custom plugins

![plugins line](https://i.imgur.com/LXR9zBA.png)

-   [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
    -   `git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting`
-   [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
    -   `git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions`
-   [zsh-256color](https://github.com/chrissicool/zsh-256color)
    -   `$ ( cd $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins && git clone https://github.com/chrissicool/zsh-256color )`
-   [wakatime-zsh-plugin](https://wakatime.com/terminal)
    -   `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins && git clone https://github.com/sobolevn/wakatime-zsh-plugin.git wakatime`
-   [colored-man-pages](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/plugins/colored-man-pages/colored-man-pages.plugin.zsh) is installed by default with Ohy-My-Zsh

One other file that my `.zshrc` depends on is `~/.bash_aliases`, which is a file that contains a bunch of aliases that I have compiled over that past year. I sym-linked the `.bash_aliases` file in the dotfiles directory to the home directory with `ln -sr ~/dotfiles/.bash_aliases ~/.bash_aliases` so that when `.zshrc` is sourced later, it is able to find `.bash_aliases` in the right spot.

After running all the install commands, I created two sym-links from the dotfiles directory: one from the `~/dotfiles/.p10kzsh`, which is the configuration file for powerlevel10k, to my home directory (`~`), and the other from `~/dotfiles/.zshrc` to the home directory. Then, I reloaded `~/.zshrc` with `source ~/.zshrc` and my zsh was set up without issues.

### Adding a new XSession

-   First, copy the existing Plasma file in the `/usr/share/xsessions` folder
    cp plasma.desktop plasma-i3.desktop
-   Next, open the newly-created `plasma-i3.desktop` file in a text editor and
    change the exec line to
    ```
    [Desktop Entry]
    Type=XSession
    Exec=env KDEWM=/usr/bin/i3 /usr/bin/startplasma-x11
    DesktopNames=KDE
    Name=Plasma (i3)
    Comment=Plasma by KDE w/i3
    ```
-   Then save and quit the file and logout of the device. Upon reaching the login
    screen, you should see the new XSession to launch into

After selecting the new XSession and logging in, i3 should be up an running

## Configuring i3 <a name="configure-i3"></a>

The next thing on my list was to configure i3 itself. I cloned the config file
from my [repo](https://github.com/ksyasuda/Sudacode-Rice) and created a sym-link
from my custom config file to the default i3 config location `~/.config/i3/config`
by running, from within the `Sudacode-Rice/configs` folder, `ln -sr config ~/.config/i3/config`.

A sym-link, or symbolic link, is analagous to a pointer in C/C++. The file at
`~/.config/i3/config` is basically a pointer to my custom config file at
`Sudacode-Rice/configs/config`. So whenever i3 runs and looks for the config
file at `~/.config/i3/config` it loads my configuration file.

My i3-gaps configuration file sets the default 'inner' gap of each window to 20.
Which basically just puts padding around each window of 20px.

Additionally, I have it set up so that certain applications launch on specific workspaces:

-   Emacs and Vim launch on workspace 1
-   Firefox launches on workspace 2
-   Vscode launches on workspace 3
-   Spotify launches on workspace 9

I have custom keybindings to do things like resizing windows, set windows
to float mode, and changing the size of the gaps between and around windows

There are also keybinding to execute bash scripts that utilize [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
to create custom application launchers, tab switchers, and menus. I go into
more detail about the rofi scrips [here](#rofi-scripts)

## Fixing The Wallpaper <a name="fixing-wallpaper"></a>

Using the i3 Window Manager with KDE Plasma, which was configured by the
Arcolinux installer brings with it a few issues. One such issue was that the
software that they were using to set the wallpaper no longer worked.

To fix this, I used [feh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/feh) a
lightweight image viewer that can be used to manage desktop wallpapers, which was
already installed on the system.

Using the command `feh --bg-scale [filename]`, I can set the wallpaper and scale
the image to my display.

Using this, I wrote a script, `new-wallpaper.sh`, to choose one folder from the
`/usr/share/wallpapers/` folder. Each folder contains the same image of varying
resolutions. My script looks for a 4k resolution image first, and if it cannot
find one, it looks for a 1080p image. If neither can be found, it chooes a
random image from the folder and relys on feh to scale the image.

![output of one of the folders](https://i.imgur.com/vjiEYxD.png)

Finally, I appended a line to the i3 config to run the `new-wallpaper.sh` script
each time i3 is run or reloaded with

```bash
echo 'exec_always --no-startup-id ~/usr/bin/new-wallpaper.sh' >> ~/.config/i3/config
```

## Setting up my Vimrc <a name="vimrc"></a>

For about 3 weeks now, I have been using Doom Emacs on the side to see if I want to use it as my main text editor for the future. However, as of now, Vim and Vscode are still my go-to's. I have `.vimrc` file in my dotfiles repo that I created a sym-link for with `ln -sr ~/dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc`.

The only thing preventing me from reloading the file and running Vim without errors is that I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), which is a plugin manager for Vim. I installed vim-plug using `curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim`. Then all that needed to be done was reload the file with `source ~/.vimrc` and open it in Vim with `vim ~/.vimrc`. Once in Vim, `:PlugInstall` to install plugins with vim-plug.

One plugin, [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe), a code-completion engine for Vim, required additional compilation before it could be used in Vim. Vim would be able to run without compiling this first, however, it would not be able to use the features of YouCompleteMe without first compiling.

1. `cd` into `~/.vim/plugged/youcompleteme`
2. Run the install script with `python install.py --all`

This will compile with everything enabled, for all languages.

After that, Vim was fully configured up to the point that I am at now. I do not think that this is my Vim endgame and my configuation is constantly changing.

## Installing and Configuring Polybar <a name="install-polybar"></a>

Now that I got the wallpaper working, I removed the default KDE bar and
installed [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) instead. I already had
a polybar configuration that I was pretty happy with from my old laptop, so I
cloned my [repo](https://github.com/ksyasuda/Sudacode-Rice) to my new laptop and
appended the following command to the i3 config file (`~/.config/i3/config`)

```bash
echo 'exec_always --no-startup-id ~/.config/polybar/scripts/launch.sh'
```

The `launch.sh` script kills any running polybar instances and then starts a new
polybar instance.

Because my old latop was 1080p and my new laptop is 4k, the font size and
overall size of the bar was a little off. So, I changed all the font size to 20 and changed the dpi to 100 to get the proportions right.

![polybar image](https://i.imgur.com/CJpuEWs.png)

I will more into depth on my Polybar configuation in a future blog post.

## Installing Picom and Setting up my Config <a name="install-picom"></a>

The next task was to install a compositor. On my Arch system, I had used a fork of
i3-gaps, called i3-gaps-rouned-corners in order to get the rounded corner
effect. However, I learned recently about [ibhagwan's picom fork](https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom) that has both
rounded-corners and blur capabilities. Since it is a fork of the original
Picom, it was compatible with my old configuration file.

In order to use the rounded corners feature I added the line `corner-radius = 15`
to the `~/.config/picom/picom.conf` file.

For the blur feature, I added the lines

```
blur: {
  method = "dual_kawase";
  strength = 8;
  background = false;
  background-frame = false;
  background-fixed = false;
}
```

With that, I had transparent and blurred windows with rounded corners.

## Rofi Scripts <a name="rofi-scripts"></a>

I have polybar modules and scripts that use [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
to create different application launchers, menus, and a window switcher.

### Examples

Full-screen application launcher

All of the scripts and configuration files can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/ksyasuda/Sudacode-Rice)

## Installing and Launching KDE Applets <a name="kde-applets"></a>

In the past, when I had used KDE Plasma in a virtual machine, I had used found and used two applets: [Event Calendar](https://github.com/Zren/plasma-applet-eventcalendar), and [TodoList](https://github.com/Zren/plasma-applet-todolist).

In order to use KDE applets with the i3 window manager, I used `plasmawindowed` and a setting in my i3 config file to force the applets to workspace 4. To make it easier to launch these apps on startup, I wrote two separate scripts that I run from the i3 config file.

```bash
# ~/scripts/calendar.sh
plasmawindowed org.kde.plasma.eventcalendar &
```

![applets](https://i.imgur.com/Ly9LhIQ.png)

## Other Programs/Scripts <a <name="other-things"></a>

The configuration files for the following progrmas can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/ksyasuda/Sudacode-Rice).

**_I have renamed the directory from `Sudacode-Rice` to `i3` on my machine._**

### [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs)

As I mentioned earlier, I have been messing around with Doom Emacs recently, and this post was written using Doom Emacs as the text editor and as a terminal. Emacs was already installed in my installation of Arcolinux, so all I had to do was install Doom Emacs on top of it.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
```

By running the above command and making sure that `~/.emacs.d/bin` is in the `PATH`, Doom Emacs will be installed and configurable. I copied the files from my Sudacode-Rice reposity (renamed to i3) with `cp ~/i3/doom/* ~/.doom.d/`. Then run `doom sync`. The `doom` command is a command installed with Doom Emacs in the `.emacs.d/bin` directory, which is why it is nice to have it in `PATH`. However it can be run with an absolute path as `~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync` as with all scripts.

![Doom Emacs](https://i.imgur.com/7p702dj.png)

### [Cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava)

Cava is a Console Based Audio Visualizer or ALSA, which also supports input from Pulseaudio (what I'm using), mpd, sndio, squeezelite, and portaudio. The configuration file that I have in my repository was immediately compatible with my machine so I created a directory in `~/.config` for cava and copied over the config file from my repo.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/cava
cp ~/i3/config/cavaconfig ~/.config/cava/config
```

![cava image](https://i.imgur.com/uOkFzXM.png)

### [Ranger](https://ranger.github.io/)

For ranger, the only additional software I needed to install on my system was [ranger_devicons](https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/ranger_devicons) with `git clone https://github.com/alexanderjeurissen/ranger_devicons ~/.config/ranger/plugins/ranger_devicons`. Then I copied the `rc.conf` file from my repo to `~/.config/ranger`.

To get images to render in Ranger, my configuration uses `w3mimgdisplay`, which is included in an install of the [w3m web browser](http://w3m.sourceforge.net/). Rendering video previews requires `ffmpegthumbnailer`, which was also installed on my system already. For me, I was able to use Ranger without issues and with all features enabled after this, however, it may be necessary to get a new `scope.sh` file by running `ranger --copy-config=scope` and configuring the generated `scope.sh` file manually as taked about [here](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/wiki/Video-Previews) and [here](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/wiki/Image-Previews).

![ranger image](https://i.imgur.com/T4KN14J.jpg)

### `random_starter.sh`

At the end of my `~/.zshrc`, I call `random_starter.sh`, which chooses one command, out of a preset array of options, and runs the command each time `~/.zshrc` is loaded. At the moment, it only includes `archey3`, `screenfetch`, `neofetch`, and `cowtune`.

### cowtune

`cowtune` is a fun script that I wrote, which I'm sure has been done a milion times before, that pipes the output from `fortune` to `cowsay`. It then pipes that output to `lolcat` to get rainbow colors. The script has the additional feature of choosing one theme from `/usr/share/cows/` to apply to the `cowsay` command.

![cowtune output](https://i.imgur.com/xfeDg4O.png)

## Conclusion

Now, I have configured my laptop to the same point that my old laptop is at. I will continue to experiment and change my configurations in the future and will probably never be satisfied fully. You can keep track of my progress [here on my blog](https://sudacode.com/blog) in future posts, or on my [github](https://github.com/ksyasuda). Currently, I have two repos that I use in everyday ricing. My [dotfiles repo](https://github.com/ksyasuda/dotfiles) contains the dotfiles in my home directory (except for the Doom Emacs config files as they are not themselves dotfiles) like `.zshrc` and `.vimrc`. The [Sudacode-Rice repo](https://github.com/ksyasuda/Sudacode-Rice) contains configurations files for installed software like `polybar` and `cava`.
