<h2>Introduction</h2>

Last year, at the start of my Junior year at the University of Michigan, I had to to upgrade my 5 year old laptop as the laptop that I was using at the time would only last about 45 minutes on battery.

That laptop had been sitting in my closet for the past year until this summer when I brought it home with me and installed Arch Linux.

_This is not meant to be an installation guide, but rather an account of my experience during setup and customization._
