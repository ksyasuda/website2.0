In my [blog post](https://sudacode.com/BlogPosts/Installing-And-Ricing-Arcolinux/)
about installing and ricing (customizing) ArcoLinux on my personal laptop,
I showcased the software that I have installed and the configuration that I had
done to the overall system.  One of the main components of the rice is the [Polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)
bar that I have at the to of my screen.

![the bar](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/4695/YZfW6K.png)

The bar is the only permanent element of my desktop.  Because of that, it also
contains only the information or functionality that I deem necessary to have
quick access to.  Each section of the bar is called a ___module___. The _volume module_ is a
good example of a something that brings necessary information and functionality.
Other than displaying the current volume percentage, left clicking the module
will toggle mute and right clicking the module will open up `pavucontrol`, the
pulseaudio GUI for volume control.  While some of the modules like the _Spotify_
and _Japanese date_ modules are less needed than others, they all serve their
purpose and have their own reason for taking up as much space as they do.

Many of the modules in my bar are adapted from either the examples from the
docs or scripts that other people wrote.  The Japanese date module is the
exception, being the only script that is completely my own.

## Menu Module <a name="menu"></a>
![menu icon](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/9092/zfPDrl.png)

The menu is a simple custom script module with the Arch Linux logo as the icon.
On a left click, the module executes the custom rofi script I have to launch a 3
column application launcher.

The right click will execute a full-screen custum rofi applicaion launcher.

The application launchers function like any other application launcher, allowing
the user to search for and launch any application installed on the system.  It
allows for navigation using the arrow keys as well as a mouse.

## Workspaces Module <a name="workspaces"></a>
![workspace module](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/3170/pi9ZlC.png)

The workspace module is of type `internal/xworkspaces` and is adapted from the
example given in the [docs](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/Module:-xworkspaces).

</p>

The `icon-default` is a remnant of a previous version of the module.  The icons
are actually set in the `%name%` variable, which is defined in
`~/.config/i3/config`.  

Other than that, the only other modificaions I made were
cosmetic changes to the foreground and background of the labels.

## Network Module <a name="network"></a>
![network module](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/6386/UCFFhO.png)

The network module is another that is adapted from the example in the docs.
The only chages were cosmetic such as changing the icon and the label.  I
made it so that the label would be green when connected to the internet and
red when not.

## Bluetooth Module <a name="bluetooth"></a>

</p>

The module is a customized version of [rofi-bluetooth](https://github.com/ClydeDroid/rofi-bluetooth).

It allows for connecting, scanning, pairing, and toggling bluetooth on
the device.  I have also set it up so right-clicking the module will open up
`blueman-manager`, a GUI that I am also farmiliar with, for extreme cases (or to
forcefully forget a device).

## Spotify Module <a name="spotify"></a>
![spotify module](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/4828/QEAf1y.png)

The spotify module is split into two separate parts: the controls (next/previous
song), and the currently playing song.

For the controls, I wrote a custom script that takes in either 'prev' or 'next'
and prints out the corresponding icon.  Then the `click-left` is set to either
`playerctl next spotify` or `playerctl previous spotify`.

Outputting the currently playing song is handled by a customized version of
[polybar-spotify](https://github.com/Jvanrhijn/polybar-spotify).

![custom spotify bar](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/4315/vsK30u.png)

The `spotify_status.py` script is included in `polybar-spotify`.  All the
configuration to the script is done through command-line arguments.  
- `-t` truncates the output at the specified number of characters.
- `-p` sets the play/pause icons
- `-f` is for formatting the output.
- `--playpause-font` sets the font to use for the output.

## Package Updates Module <a name="packages"></a>
![package update module](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/6581/NZDxet.png)

There are a lot of variants of this module, and I had even created my own
(worse) version of the implementation I use now.  The method that I am currently
using was taken from [this Reddit
comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/gwccb3/is_there_a_way_to_show_the_number_of_outdated/fsuquiy/?context=3).

It checks both `Pacman` and the `AUR` (in my case `yay`) for any packages that
can be updated.  It also includes code for a custom hook to add to
`/etc/pacman.d/hooks/`, which updates the package count after an install/update.

## Japanese Date Module <a name="jdate"></a>
![japanese date module](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/672/WszLHg.png)

This is accomplished with a custom Python script that I wrote and will talk more
about in a future blog post.

For now, I will say that it parses the current date into its separate parts and
converts each part to its Japanese equivalent.  

For example, with the year 2020,
my script will break that up into `[2000, 0, 20, 0]`.  From there, it will
convert each part into Japanese with any value of zero being converted into an
empty string instead.  After the conversion the array would look like this: `['二千','','二十','',]`.

## System Volume Module <a name="volume"></a>
![sys volume module](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/2120/gek59k.png)

![sys volume off](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/189/w9YR2O.png)

The volume module was one that was slightly adapted from the example given in
the docs.  The only change I made was to the foreground color.  I made it so
when muted, the label is colored red.  Otherwise, the label is light-blue.

## Weather Module <a name="weather"></a>
![weather module](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/2581/woB4Pn.png)

This module was very slightly modified from [polybar-scripts/openweathermap-fullfeatured](https://github.com/polybar/polybar-scripts/tree/master/polybar-scripts/openweathermap-fullfeatured).  The script pulls additional information including chance of rain and the trend in the weather and outputs that all by default.  I had limited space left in my bar and as a result, I decided to output only the current temperature and the associated icon.

## Time/Date Module <a name="timedate"></a>
![time](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img923/8831/2WRNoM.png)

![date](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/4674/n6zZNN.png)

This module was taken straight from the example in the docs.  The only change I
made was chaning the foreground color to match the rest of the modules.

The clock updates in real-time and is in sync with the system clock.  Clicking
on the module toggles the output from time to date and vice versa.

## Power Menu Module <a name="powermenu"></a>
![powermenu](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img922/774/Sqnp4S.png)

The powermenu module is another custom rofi script.  Unfortunatley, I have lost
the link to the original poster.

![custom script](https://imagizer.imageshack.com/img924/6315/alHg1R.png)

I made some slight modifications, including changing the rofi theme (line 54) and the
font/font size (line 48).

## What next?
My bar is by no means at its final stage.  There are still some minor spacing
bugs in the bar that I would like to get ironed out.  Additionally, due to the
limitations of polybar with i3, I am unable to move the bar anywhere but the top
or bottom of the screen.  There is a way to allow free positioning of the bar,
but then i3 does not reserve space for the bar and draws all windows over the
bar.

As a result, I will probably try to recreate my bar with a different program in
the future.  I know that there are packages that exist that are like Polybar but
configurable in a programming language instead of with `.ini` configuration
files.  Something like this would definitely help with customization and I will
probably try to find something to potentially replace Polybar soon.
