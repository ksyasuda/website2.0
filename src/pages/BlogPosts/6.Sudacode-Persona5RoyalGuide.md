During the First Great Lockdown of 2020, I bought and started playing the
original Persona 5 on the PS4.  Simply put, I was amazed.  It was a perfect
blend of classic JRPG and life sim.  What takes it to the next level, in my
opinion, is the limited amount of time you have during the game.  I constantly
found myself referencing online guides for Persona fusion, classroom answers,
and how to level up my stats.

This past month, I have been playing through the remastered version, Persona 5
Royal.
