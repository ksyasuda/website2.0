During the First Great Lockdown of 2020, I bought and started playing the
original Persona 5 on the PS4.  Simply put, I was amazed.  It was a perfect
blend of classic JRPG and life sim.  What takes it to the next level, in my
opinion, is the limited amount of time you have during the game.  I constantly
found myself referencing online guides for Persona fusion, classroom answers,
and how to level up my stats.

That's why, this past month, while I've been playing through the remastered
version, Persona 5 Royal, I decided to write this helper script.  Currently, it
can provide answers to questions given in class, answers for confidants, a list
of the best gifts for a given confidant, and a list of daily/weekly/special activities.
